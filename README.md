## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Fetch images from Unsplash, scyle through the images on mousemove, leaving a trail...

Features:

- mousmove custom hook
- fetch()
- useRef()
- Math.hypot() to calculate distance between points âœ¨

## Optimizations

add some mobile styles (a clickable slideshow?), animate the image exits?, not sure a search bar is ideal UI but this is just a demo...
